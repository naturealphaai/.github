### General Guidelines

- **Documentation**:
  - Ensure each repository has a comprehensive `README.md` file.
  - At a minimum, the `README.md` should describe the repository's purpose.
  - If applicable, include instructions on how to run the code, installation steps, usage examples, and any dependencies.

- **Branching, Commits, and Issues**:
  - Write branches, commits, and issues as descriptively as possible.
  - Branches should follow a consistent naming convention, such as `feature/short-description` or `bugfix/short-description`.
  - Commit messages should be meaningful and describe what the commit does. Use the format: `type(scope): message`.
  - Issues should clearly state the problem or feature request, including relevant details and context.
  - Merge requests (MRs) should clearly describe what is being added or changed. They should be issue-specific and not aggregate months of work.
  - Ensure that each MR is focused on a single issue or feature to facilitate easier reviews and integrations.
